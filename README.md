## Introduction

This project aims to analyze traffic accident data to uncover patterns and visualize hotspots. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by policymakers and traffic safety experts to improve road safety measures.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information on traffic accidents, including details such as time, location, weather conditions, and road conditions. Key columns in the dataset include:

- `ID`
- `Start_Time`
- `End_Time`
- `Start_Lat`
- `Start_Lng`
- `Weather_Condition`
- `Temperature(F)`
- `Visibility(mi)`
- `Traffic_Signal`
- And many more...

## Analysis

This project involves comprehensive analysis of traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The analyses performed include:

### Weather Conditions Analysis
- We analyzed the weather conditions present at the time of accidents to identify which conditions are most commonly associated with accidents. By counting the occurrences of each weather condition and plotting the top 20, we gain insights into how different weather scenarios affect accident rates.

### Time of Day Analysis
- We analyzed the distribution of accidents over different times of the day to determine peak accident hours. By plotting the number of accidents by hour, we can identify times of the day when accidents are most frequent, helping to inform targeted safety measures.

### Contributing Factors Analysis
- We examined various factors contributing to accidents, such as the presence of traffic signals, road conditions, and visibility. This analysis helps identify key factors that increase the risk of accidents.

## Visualization

### Weather Conditions Visualization
- Visualize the weather conditions at the time of accidents to identify the most common conditions during accidents.

### Time of Day Visualization
- Visualize the distribution of accidents over different times of the day to determine peak accident hours.
